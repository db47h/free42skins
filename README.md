# Free42 Skins

## Anthracite_small

 A small-ish (294x415) desktop skin for [free42] by Thomas Okken. Very much inspired by go41cx's skin.

Comes in two flavors, Anthracite_small has the shift function names on the keys and AnthraciteC_small has them
above the keys (classic layout):

![Anthracite small skin][anthracite_small] ![Anthracite classic small skin][anthraciteC_small]

Both also have a yellow variant for the hardcore HP41 fans:

![Anthracite/Yellow small skin][anthracite_small_Yellow] ![Anthracite/Yellow classic small skin][anthraciteC_small_Yellow]

There are now brighter variants (with a \_HC suffix) for users of dark desktop themes where Free42 dims the skin.

## Anthracite

TBD. A 1080x1920 version for smartphones.
